<p>RACE THE STREETS OF LA</p>



<!-- Story -->
<div class="boxed">
<p1> You are Mark Sloan, you have just left prison after 5 years of prison. During the end of your speed racing days you made an oath to your daughter that you would never race again after your sentencing. 
    <br/>
    
    After leaving prison you find yourself in a pridcament. All the money you made from racing was counted as illegal and seized by the police.
<br/>
    <br/>

    You think to yourself that you would be better off without the bad money you made and when you get back to Los Angelas, you'll show your daughter that you've changed.
    
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But then you get a phone call.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sloan: "Hello?"
    <br/>
    ...:"..."
    <br/>
    Sloan:"Hello!?"
    <br/>
    ...:"Mr Sloan."
    <br/>
    Sloan: "Who the hell is this?"
    <br/>
    ...:"if you wish to see your daughter again, come to Joey's Diners on Palmville Avenue 550 Los Angeles.
    <br/>
    Sloan: "Yeah whatever loser, go learn how to drive instead of sending your threats, i'm the king of streets for a reason, punk."
    <br/>
    ...:"Bring the one million dollars you owe us."
    *They hang up*
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You realise it wasn't just some jabroni who was sore about one of the losses in the street races. Its the people you stole money from back in your youth when you were just a getaway driver working for Benny.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Damn, Bennys long gone, what do I do?"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "I have no choice but to race the streets again."
